# Introduction

## Purpose
This document outlines the system requirements for developing a basic ecommerce website. The websiteâ€™s core functionality is to support online retail operations, including posting product listings, shopping cart functionality, user accounts, and order processing.

## Scope
The ecommerce webservice will include the following key components:
Product catalog and inventory management
User registration and authentication
Shopping cart functionality
Order placement and processing
Basic search and filtering capabilities


# Description Model

## System Requirements

1. User Authentication
   - Output:
       - Successful login confirmation.
       - User profile access post-login.
       - Error messages for failed login attempts.
   - Input:
     - User credentials (username/email, password).
     - OAuth tokens for Google Sign-In.
   - Processes:
     - Validate user credentials.
     - Handle OAuth token for Google Sign-In.
2. Create a new user account.
   - Encrypt and store user passwords securely.
      Performance:
      Quick response time for authentication requests (<1 second).
      High availability and reliability of authentication services.
      Security:
      Use HTTPS for all authentication-related communications.
      Implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
      Use strong encryption (e.g., bcrypt) for password storage.
      Ensure OAuth tokens are securely managed and stored.
3. Product Listing
